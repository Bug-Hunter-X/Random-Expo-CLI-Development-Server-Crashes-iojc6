While using Expo CLI, I encountered an error where the development server would randomly crash without providing any clear error messages in the terminal.  The app would be running fine, and then suddenly stop with no explanation. This was inconsistent and didn't happen every time, making debugging difficult. The crash wasn't specific to any particular functionality within the app.

While there's no guaranteed fix for random crashes in Expo, several strategies can improve stability.  First, try enabling Metro Bundler's debug mode for more detailed logs. Second, ensure your system has adequate memory and isn't overloaded with other processes.  Third, consider enabling more detailed logging within your Expo application to identify potential internal issues that might be contributing to the crashes.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// ... (Your Expo app code)
//Enable Metro Bundler Debug Mode (Adjust for your Expo version)
// expo start --dev --log-level debug 
// Ensure sufficient system resources
// Monitor system resources (Memory, CPU) while running Expo
```
